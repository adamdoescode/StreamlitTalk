# Streamlit is good! (for some things!)

## Quick notes

- Use `uv` for my env here

### How?

- We should do a presentation in streamlit!
- What better demo than to use it as a slideshow :)

### What?

- Things I want to explore/discuss:
  - how streamlit works (React*-style* frontend with python scripting?)
  - basics of what you can do with it:
    - quick prototyping
    - great for simple, easy on the eyes, GUIs
    - how pages work
    - simple API:
      - widgets
      - other stuff?
    - Good integrations for:
      - dataframes
      - plotting and plotly
      - maps
  - It's limits;
    - limited ability to handle deep complexity
    - see if we can find some footguns
  - caching and session state are messy topics worth touching on.
    - st.rerun is cursed ☠️
    - `st.session_state`
