- Web stuff is confusing and scary
- Python is nice because I already know it
- What if I just write my web app in python?
- Surely there will be no consequences for this.

## Similar to...

- Other solutions to :blue["make web dev easy for data scientists"] exist.
- Dash
  - VERY similar use case to streamlit.
  - The [minimal dash app](https://dash.plotly.com/minimal-app) was far too complex and scary for me.
  - last time I tried `conda install` on dash it broke so I never even tried it tbh.
  - It did, however, install in this repo with `uv add dash`...
- Shiny
  - R framework designed for R data scientists scared of React (and possibly Python?)
  - I have used this and liked it. Impressed my boss at the time with a demo. Once saw some HORRIFIC academic code using this for a rather user friendly personal genomics website (sadly taken down now).
- Jupyter widgets
  - I use these, and like them. But man, they are *not* performant or reproducible!
  - Mind you, streamlit widgets with plotly can chug too.
- [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/)
  - Terminal GUI apps, with easy web app deploys (on localhost anyway).
  - Amazing, so cool. Wish I had a good excuse to use it more.
